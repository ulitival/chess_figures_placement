    This solution utilizes a CSP approach using ``ortools`` package. The definition is the following:
        - variables: ``fields`` on a chessboard, the number of variables is ``board_size x board_size``
        - domain: ``[0, 1]``, 0 for unoccupied field, 1 for occupied
        - constraints:
            - there are exactly N knights placed on a chessboard: ``sum(fields) == N``,
            - there are not any pair of knights that are within reach of each other, that is to say,
                all fields are occupied in such a way that N knights cannot attack one another. This
                constraint is defined by utilising the following fact:
                ``fields[knight1_position] + fields[knight2_position] < 2``

    For calculating possible fields where knights can attack there is defined a global constants
    ``KNIGHT_ATTACK_RANGE``. Normally, a knight can attack 8 fields around itself. Although,
    due to symmetry only 4 fields are needed to cover all attack cases.
